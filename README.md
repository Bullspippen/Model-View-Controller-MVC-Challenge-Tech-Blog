## Description

The Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site that allows developers to publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts and opinions on various tech topics. The site is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm and uses various npm packages, including Express.js, Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and bcrypt, to implement authentication, a MySQL database, and dynamic HTML templates.

The Tech Blog site features a homepage that displays existing blog posts, if any have been posted, and includes navigation links for the homepage and dashboard. Visitors to the site are prompted to log in or sign up when they attempt to access other pages. Once logged in, users can create new blog posts, view their existing posts, edit or delete their posts, leave comments on other users' posts, and view comments on their own posts. When idle on the site for more than a set time, users are prompted to log in again to add, update, or delete comments.

The site is deployed to Heroku and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. The Tech Blog is a great resource for developers who want to stay up-to-date on the latest tech trends and share their insights and opinions with a community of like-minded individuals.
